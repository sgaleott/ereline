Ereline - Planck/LFI calibration pipeline for Erebor
====================================================


Introduction
------------

Ereline is a re-implementation of the Planck/LFI calibration pipeline.
It has been designed for testing different approaches in the
calibration and to checking the robustness of LFI's results.

It is written in C++ and accesses data written in FITS format. The
current plan is to simulate the following features of the instrument:

- Differentiation of noisy total-power data
- Effect of non-ideal beams in the observation of the sky
- Presence of a Doppler effect due to the satellite's motion
- Time-dependent gain instabilities


Dependencies
------------

The code uses C++11 features, so you need a reasonably recent C++
compiler (GCC 4.8.x is ok).

The code needs the Boost library (http://www.boost.org) to compile.
Version 1.41 is the oldest one known to be usable with Ereline. The
following modules are used:

- Boost::date_time
- Boost::property_tree
- Boost::test

If you want to build the Developer's manual, you need to install
Doxygen as well (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen).


How to compile the code
-----------------------

Download the code to some directory (e.g. /opt/ereline), then run the
following commands from your home directory:

$ mkdir ereline_build
$ cd ereline_build
$ /opt/ereline/configure --with-boost=PATH_TO_BOOST && make
$ make check

(note that you do not have to run "configure" and "make" in the same
directory as the source code -- this allows to keep the source in a
read-only folder.)

The last command ("make check") is optional: it ensures that the code
works as expected by running a number of test programs and checking
that their results agrees with the expectations.


Development status
------------------

Currently only a few basic modules have been implemented:

- Logging
- Configuration file reading


License
-------

We have still to decide which license to use. In the long run, it will
probably be an open-source license, but at the moment we want to keep
it private until the whole Planck dataset will be released to the
public.
