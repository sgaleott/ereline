.. An introduction to Ereline

Introduction
============

Ereline is an implementation of the Planck/LFI calibration pipeline.
Its purpose is to fully reproduce the way Planck/LFI raw radiometric
data are processed by the official pipeline to produce the primary
scientific results, i.e., frequency maps of the sky and power spectra.

Ereline is a collection of C++ codes and a set of files that describe
the instrument. It does not include the full data released by the
Planck collaboration, as its main purpose is to assess the performance
and quality of the pipeline elaboration by means of simulations, not
to do analysis on real data.
