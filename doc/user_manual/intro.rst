.. An introduction to Ereline

Introduction
============

Ereline is an implementation of the Planck/LFI calibration pipeline.
Its purpose is to fully reproduce the way Planck/LFI raw radiometric
data are processed by the official pipeline to produce the primary
scientific results, i.e., frequency maps of the sky and power spectra.

Ereline is a collection of C++ codes and a set of files that describe
the instrument. It does not include the full data released by the
Planck collaboration, as this should be downloaded separately using
the official `ESA Planck homepage
<http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=Planck>`_.
